How to Download NAIP images for large scale
If you want to download all NAIP images for a state, you must make a grid for the state. I divide the state into 90 or 100 tiles.
Then, check the coverage of the states and the number of images.
After that, download the images take place and then, the images will be mosaicked and clipped for each tile.
